# Restaurant Reviews Website - Static to Responsive

## About this Project

The aim of this **Restaurant Reviews** project is converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took the static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Starter Code

You can find the starter code of this project via [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

## How can you check the final design?

1. Clone this repository to your local computer.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/ to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
